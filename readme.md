# Booking CLI App GoLang

I recently completed the "[Golang Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana)" on [@TechWorldwithNana](https://www.youtube.com/%40TechWorldwithNana)'s YouTube channel and it was an amazing learning experience.

This full Golang course taught me everything I needed to get started with Go and start using it in my projects.

The course covered everything from the basics of Go syntax and concepts to more advanced topics like concurrency in Go.

**Instead of just learning the concepts and syntax of Go with isolated examples, the course allowed me to learn them while building an actual CLI application.**

Before diving into the syntax, the course also provided a brief introduction to Go, including its use cases and how it's different from other programming languages.

**Overall, I was very curious about Go and this course satisfied my curiosity and made me eager to dive more deeply into Golang and its features. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Go!**
